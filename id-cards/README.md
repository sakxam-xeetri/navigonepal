## ➕ Adding New Members & Printing Cards

To add new members and print their cards easily:
- Use the **"New Member Card"** button inside the portal to create a card directly on screen.
- Or append a new JSON object into `id-cards/members.json`.
- **Automatic QR Short URLs**: Every ID card's QR code automatically encodes a clean short verification link (`https://navigonepal.org/idcard/1`, `https://navigonepal.org/idcard/2`, `https://navigonepal.org/idcard/18`, etc.).
- When scanned, the QR code resolves directly to the member's official verified profile page.
